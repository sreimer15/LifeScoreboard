There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  FitBit for your mental Health. 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Track how your day has been, and compare to others. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Have an interactive visualization of how your day has been in the past. 
  Everyday, rate your day from a scale of 1-10 and save the data, seeing how it has changed.
  Compare how happy you usually are on mondays.
  Mark Important Events and see how your days have been since that event.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Our impressions of our past selves are very murky. How happy were we? It is hard to disagree with what we felt on a particular day in the past. Especially if we see dramatic changes after an event.
  Furthermore, let's say I have particular traits, that affect my happiness in some particular way. How happy are other people who share those traits? Anonymized data to compare to others would give me a better understanding of myself.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Using data visualization to make this sort of diary cool is awesome.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  Track your happiness, compare it to others! Understand how important life decisions have affected your life.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Everyday, input your happiness for a day, and over time the data does the work for you. THe visualizaton helps you see trends.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  I was in an abusive relationship with my work and would justify my past by saying that it was ok. I was learning a lot. After 3 months I looked back on my happiness graph and saw how constantly my happiness fell and fell.
  I couldn't deny it any longer that this job was making me deeply unhappy so I started to make the move to transition out of htere.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  Take it seriously, the more honest you are with your feelings the more likely it is that the data will be helpful for you.
